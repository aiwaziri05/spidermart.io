## 1. Project Overview

SpiderMart is a **scalable SaaS multi-vendor e-commerce platform** focused on promoting Nigerian culturally unique products (leather, textiles, shoes, clothes, and bags) to both local and global markets.

The current phase is a **frontend-only MVP** built with **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**, structured for a future **Next.js migration**. All backend-related features (authentication, payments, order history, vendor management) will be mocked with placeholder data and API stubs.
